Exploring front-end development through practice projects has been an essential part of my growth, and this Next.js project was no exception. I decided to recreate the About page of Ableton, focusing on understanding the intricacies of web design and layout.

## Project Highlights

Recreating the Ableton page involved diving deep into responsive design principles and accurately implementing typography and spacing. The goal was to closely replicate the visual elements while ensuring the cloned page was responsive across devices. This project helped me refine my skills in Next.js, CSS, and working with modular, reusable components.

## Key Takeaways

- **Responsive Design**: Focused on creating a layout that adapts seamlessly across different screen sizes, ensuring users have a consistent experience.
- **Typography and Spacing**: Paid attention to details like font choices, line spacing, and padding to match the design aesthetics.
- **Grid Layouts**: Implemented unique grid structures to arrange content effectively, mimicking the original design's flow.
- **Next.js & CSS Modules**: Leveraged Next.js for efficient routing and used CSS Modules to ensure styles were scoped and reusable.
