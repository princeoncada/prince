Recreating existing websites is an excellent way to hone design and development skills. For this project, I took on the challenge of cloning the website for 'Backstage Talks,' a magazine known for its engaging discussions on design and business. The goal was to replicate the site’s design, typography, and layout to understand the nuances of effective web presentation.

## Project Highlights

This project involved studying the original site’s design details and implementing them with precision, focusing on responsive layouts, dynamic typography, and clear visual hierarchy. Each section of the page was carefully structured to reflect the unique style of Backstage Talks.

## Key Takeaways

- **Design Fidelity**: Emphasized exact replication of layout, color schemes, and font styling to match the original site.
- **Responsive Layout**: Developed with responsive design principles to ensure the site is visually consistent across various devices.
- **Typography and Spacing**: Focused on achieving clean, readable typography with accurate spacing, mirroring the magazine’s aesthetic.
