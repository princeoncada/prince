## Overview

In this project, I developed tailored automation solutions for two business clients, MS BUSSING and KSE, using Google Apps Script. The goal was to streamline operations, improve data management, and automate repetitive tasks to save time and reduce errors. These automations integrated seamlessly with existing Google Workspace applications, enabling both clients to enhance their business processes effectively.

## Key Features

### MS Bussing

- **Checklist System for Agents**: Developed an automated checklist that helps agents efficiently track which buses need monitoring, ensuring that no buses are overlooked.
- **Alert & Notification System**: Implemented automated alerts that are sent directly to a messaging app, notifying agents and clients about late departures and other important updates requiring follow-up.
- **Client Communication Automation**: Automated the process of sending notifications to clients, keeping them informed about any delays or issues that need attention, ensuring prompt and effective communication.
- **Conditional Formatting**: Enhanced data visibility and tracking with conditional formatting, making it easier to identify status updates and key insights at a glance.

### KSE

- **Automated Customer Data Management**: Created a dynamic database system to manage customer data, including automation to add unique customers and track the most sold items.
- **Automatic Column Addition & Monthly Data Assignment**: Developed features to automatically add new columns and assign them to appropriate months, simplifying data entry and analysis.
- **Advanced Data Cross-Referencing**: Implemented complex formulas to cross-reference data by month, product, or customer, enabling detailed and accurate reporting.
- **Conditional Formatting**: Enhanced data visibility and tracking with conditional formatting, making it easier to identify patterns and key insights at a glance.

## Technologies Used

- **Google Apps Script**: For automating tasks, creating custom scripts, and integrating Google Workspace applications.
- **Google Sheets**: As the primary platform for data management, reporting, and automation.
- **Complex Formulas & Conditional Formatting**: To ensure robust and detailed data processing.

## Challenges and Learnings
Developing reliable automations that could handle various exceptions was essential for both clients. The challenge was to ensure that the scripts could scale and accommodate new requirements without needing significant manual adjustments. Understanding the intricacies of real-time messaging integration and creating error-handling mechanisms were key learning points that improved the overall robustness of the solutions.

## Outcome
The automation solutions I developed have significantly enhanced the efficiency of business operations for both MS BUSSING and KSE. Agents at MS BUSSING now have a clearer, streamlined process for tracking bus schedules, while KSE benefits from a robust database system that simplifies customer data management and reporting. These automations have saved time, reduced manual errors, and improved overall communication and data visibility.
