## Overview

For Milk Denmark, a baby clothing brand, I developed a responsive and visually appealing e-commerce website using Shopify theme development.

- **Multi-Column Footer**: Organized essential links like customer support, brand story, and social media into a clean, multi-column footer for easy navigation.

## Technologies Used
